# Crop Yields Around the World - EDA

 ### This project contains a brief studing analysis of the following dataset: [Our World in Data - Crop Yields](https://ourworldindata.org/crop-yields)
 <ol> The dataset has crop yields information about several agriculture products since 1275 until 2022, represented in tons per hectare. It also has regional information from FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations), meaning that there are numerous analysis that can be made.
 <ol> For this studying project, I chose to analyze and explore crop yields of rice, soybean and corn (maize). Since soybean and maize are largest produced in Brazil and rice not as much, we can have a view of different scenarios for different countries group and for the FAO data.
